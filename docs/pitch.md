**FAMILY BANK: A STRUCTURED BLUEPRINT**

---

## 1. INTRODUCTION
Family Bank is a home-based, gamified financial system designed to teach children the fundamentals of earning, spending, trading, and managing money. Unlike traditional banks that maintain balanced inflows and outflows, Family Bank operates with infinite funds as a "sink" - focusing on teaching financial concepts rather than maintaining real monetary balance. The concept extends beyond a simple chore chart by introducing:
- A parent-controlled currency with infinite supply.
- Dynamic pricing and inflation adjustments.
- Inter-sibling and inter-family exchanges.
- Audit trails for accountability and behavior tracking.

---

## 2. OBJECTIVES
1. **Teach Financial Concepts:** Children learn earning/spending, supply/demand, inflation, taxation, and currency exchange.
2. **Encourage Responsibility:** Completing chores and tasks yields "income." Leisure and entertainment have "costs."
3. **Promote Negotiation & Cooperation:** Kids practice trading and conflict resolution within predefined rules.
4. **Allow Customization:** Parents control exchange rates, reward amounts, tax or penalty rules.

---

## 3. KEY STAKEHOLDERS
1. **Parents (Bankers)**
   - Mint currency.
   - Adjust valuations, inflation, and tax rates.
   - Approve or deny transactions, chores, or appeals.
2. **Children (Accountholders)**
   - Earn currency by completing tasks.
   - Spend currency on leisure activities or privileges.
   - Exchange currency or request help from siblings/cousins.
3. **Extended Family (Multi-Family Setup)**
   - Approve external currency exchange across families.
   - Implement family-specific exchange rates.

---

## 4. CORE FEATURES
1. **Currency Management**
   - Parents create unlimited "Family Dollars" or "Coins" (bank as a sink).
   - Ability to track balances per individual.
   - No need to maintain balanced books like traditional banks.
2. **Task & Reward System**
   - Configurable tasks with variable payout (e.g., chore = +20, reading = +50).
   - Costs for certain activities (e.g., 1 hour of TV = –100).
3. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - Parents change exchange rates, inflation factors, or reward values.
   - Instant or scheduled inflation events (e.g., daily price changes).
4. **Transaction Audit & Approvals**
   - Every transaction logged.
   - Parent-led approval flow for chore completion or large trades.
   - Option for appeals if children dispute a payout.
5. **Inter-Sibling Trading**
   - Children negotiate among themselves for help/services.
   - Full audit trail visible to parents.
6. **Taxation & Penalties**
   - Parents can impose "tax day" or "grounding penalty."
   - Random or scheduled basis.
7. **Multi-Family Currency Exchange (Phase 2)**
   - Each family can define its own exchange rate.
   - Approval by both families for cross-family transfers.
   - Exchange rates need not match (e.g., 2 Family-A Dollars = 5 Family-B Dollars).

## 5. DETAILED USE CASES

### 5.1 Earning & Spending
- **Chore Completion**  
  - Child finishes washing dishes → logs chore → parent approves → +30 Family Dollars.
- **Entertainment Cost**  
  - Child wants to watch TV → "pays" 100 Family Dollars → parent or system deducts from balance.

### 5.2 Dynamic Pricing
- **Inflation Event**  
  - Weekly, the TV cost is increased from 100 to 120. Chore reward can also be bumped up from 30 to 36 to reflect inflation.
- **Random Penalty**  
  - Child misbehaves → parent imposes a 50-Family-Dollar penalty.

### 5.3 Inter-Sibling Trading
- **Sibling A Pays Sibling B**  
  - Sibling B helps clean Sibling A's room for 40 Family Dollars.
  - Transaction: A → B, pending parent approval or auto-approve if under a threshold.

### 5.4 Appeals
- **Child Disagrees with Payout**  
  - Parent sets 20 Family Dollars for a chore, child believes it should be 25.
  - Child raises appeal → parent can revise or reject.

### 5.5 Multi-Family Transactions
- **Trading with Cousins**  
  - Simplified as another transaction type with specific policies
  - Each family defines their own receive/send policies
  - Transaction follows same flow as internal rewards/charges
  - Exchange rates and approvals handled by policies module

---

## 6. SYSTEM FLOW

1. **Task Setup**
   - Parent logs in → defines tasks, rates, costs, inflation schedules.
2. **Child Activity**
   - Child initiates a chore or requests an activity cost → logs proof (checkbox, QR code scan, photo, etc.).
3. **Approval**
   - Parent receives notification → approves or denies → system updates the child's balance.
4. **Spending / Trading**
   - Child can spend currency on privileges or trade with siblings → transaction is initiated, optionally approved, and recorded.
5. **Reports & Audit**
   - System aggregates all transactions → parents can view ledger, usage trends, and personal "financial statements" for each child.

---

## 7. EXAMPLE SCENARIOS

1. **Basic Chore Flow**
   - Child completes "Clean Dishes" → logs it → parent sees log → parent approves → child gets +25.
2. **Cost for Entertainment**
   - Child starts Netflix → system prompts a 50 Family Dollar deduction → child confirms → system logs the cost.
3. **Sibling Collaboration**
   - Sister pays Brother 30 to fold laundry → transaction logs "Brother +30, Sister –30" → parent sees it in the ledger.
4. **Tax Day**
   - Parent sets a monthly "tax day" where each child automatically loses 10% of their balance.
5. **Inflation Adjustment**
   - Weekly: chore rewards go up 10%, while entertainment costs go up 20%.
6. **Cross-Family Exchange**
   - Child has 100 A-Dollars → trades with cousin who has B-Dollars → final amounts vary according to both families' chosen exchange rates.
